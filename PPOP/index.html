              <h2>About Olivia</h2>
              <p>Olivia Pillari graduated from the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor in the Spring of 2018 with a major degree in Biopsychology, Cognition & Neuroscience and a minor focus in Sales & Marketing. Upon graduation, she took a job offer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center where she worked within the Pediatrics Department to facilitate an exceptional patient care experience.</p>
              <p> During her time at MSKCC, Olivia recognized that almost every aspect of healthcare management and documentation is becoming digitized. Her recognition of this trend was only further reinforced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic — hospital administrators, providers and patients are becoming increasingly dependent on virtual, tech-based, modes of communication and care. In February 2021, Olivia began her journey to becoming a Software Engineer and joined Altcademy’s Full Stack Web Development Online Course. Olivia stands by her decision in doing so as she realizes that programming is the future of every forward-thinking industry, company, hospital, you name it. At the core of everything Olivia does, both personally and professionally, she remains a problem solver. For this reason and more, she is excited to continue this next step in her professional career.
